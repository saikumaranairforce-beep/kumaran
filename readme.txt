# Website Setup Instructions

Thank you for downloading your website files!

## Files Included
- index.html  → Main structure of the site
- style.css   → Styling (colors, layout, fonts)
- script.js   → JavaScript functionality (navigation, form handling, animations)

## How to Run Locally
1. Unzip the folder `website_files.zip` to a location on your computer.
2. Ensure all three files (`index.html`, `style.css`, `script.js`) are in the **same folder**.
3. Double-click `index.html` to open it in your default web browser.
4. The site should display with full styling and navigation.

## Notes
- The **contact form** uses a `mailto:` link. When you submit, it will try to open your default email client with a pre-filled message.
- Ensure you have an email client (like Outlook, Thunderbird, or Apple Mail) configured on your computer for this feature to work properly.

## Customization
- You can edit `style.css` to change colors, fonts, or layout.
- Modify `index.html` content to update text, headings, or add/remove sections.
- Extend `script.js` if you want more advanced interactions.

Enjoy your new website!
